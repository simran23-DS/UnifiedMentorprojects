## 🚀 How to Use

> **Do NOT run the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab**, as they may not work correctly in local environments due to dependencies or environment settings.

### ✅ Steps to Run in Google Colab:

1. Open the GitHub repository in your browser.
2. Navigate to the `.ipynb` file you want to run.
3. Click on the small `Open in Colab` button (if available), or:
4. Replace `github.com` with `colab.research.google.com/github` in the URL.
   - Example:
     ```
     https://github.com/username/repo-name/blob/main/notebook.ipynb
     ↓
     https://colab.research.google.com/github/username/repo-name/blob/main/notebook.ipynb
     ```
5. The notebook will open in Colab. From there, you can:
   - Click **"Runtime" > "Run all"** to execute the entire notebook.
   - Modify and experiment as needed.
